# AgriCompat

This project adds Agricraft support for a handful of new mods.

A few things to note:
- If the soil grants a bonus of any kind (such as faster growth or higher yield), it may not affect the Crop Sticks or what is planted on them. However, bonuses like not requiring water, or being unable to be trampled, should work just fine.
- None of the added plants have mutations, as that would be an enormous project and out of scope for me. However, I will accept PRs on GitHub if you'd like to add your own.
- You do not need to have all the mods listed in order to use these jsons. If a particular mod is not present, content from that mod will simply be ignored.

## Here is a list of all the mods that have had their soils and plants added:
- Cuisine *
- Farming for Blockheads
- Growthcraft *
- Some additional HarvestCraft items
- Mystical World
- Roots
- Rustic *
- Silent's Gear
- Silent's Gems
- XL Food Mod

In addition, it fixes an issue with the Inferium seeds from Mystical Agriculture (thanks to cebbyS from the AgriCraft discord!). It also changes the amount of output from the tiered Inferium crops: current default behavior is that all Inferium plants have the same yield range, this will make the higher tiers actually give you more essence. Additionally, each tier has a chance of generating one extra essence, compared to planting them normally.

* Some crops in these mods are not compatible with crop sticks due to their unusual growth stage textures.
